Funeral Elegy by W.S.
W[illiam] S[hakespeare], "A Funeral Elegy for Master William Peter,"
(London: G.Eld for T.Thorpe, 1612).  Normalized text, ed. Donald Foster.The love I bore to your brother, and will do to his memory, hath craved
from me this last duty of a friend; I am herein but a second to the
privilege of truth, who can warrant more in his behalf than I undertook to
deliver.  Exercise in this kind I will little affect, and am less addicted
to, but there must be miracle in that labor which, to witness my
remembrance to this departed gentleman, I would not willingly undergo.  Yet
whatsoever is here done, is done to him and to him only. For whom and whose
sake I will not forget to remember any friendly respects to you, or to any
of those that have loved him for himself, and himself for his
deserts.
